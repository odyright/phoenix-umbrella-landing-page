 # Insc.Umbrella

### this project includes the [skylake](https://github.com/ariiiman/skylake) library == **svg morphing animation menu**

Hello, you are welcome,

this repository aims building something good, nice && well design. But i'm still learning and i'll be glad if you could/would contribute.

Thanks!


# USAGE

### 1. Install "ELIXIR" [installation page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
`$ mix local.hex`
### 2. Install "ERLANG" [installation page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#installing-erlang) or [erlang page](http://www.erlang.org/downloads)
```
$ wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install esl-erlang
```
### 3. Now Install "PHOENIX Framework" [installation page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#installing-erlang)
I suggest to use the new `phx.new` project generator, you can install it with this archive by doing:
`$ mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phx_new.ez`
the last release at this moment is **v1.3.0-rc.2** it could change in the future...

### 4. And Start the app:
To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

- Clone this repo, then rename it to `insc_umbrella` cd  to the new directory (or root directory):
  - example:    3 directories= 'app', 'config', and 'deps' etc. 
- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Start Phoenix router with `mix phx.server`
Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

If there are errors:
- Open assets's directory and run npm install: for example
```
$ cd apps/insc_web/assets
$ npm install
```

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
